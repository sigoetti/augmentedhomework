#Augmented Homework

I've read in the newspapers that Swiss teachers had to switch to homeschooling over one weekend. Because there was nothing digital in place they sent out big packages of paper assignments. But I think, sitting a home having to work through a big package of paper assignments must be boring.

##Idea
My idea is to use the existing homework sheets, but to augment the pictures with videos or 3d models. Like in Harry Potter. Many children do have a recent smartphone that is capable of displaying Augmented Reality. This could be cool and motivating. I've seen videos of augmented advertisements online so that was I wanted to do for schools.

##Approach
I've augmented paper before, using web technologies. It works, but not really good and is often dependent on the browser version. I recently began to learn Flutter and did a small AR project. So I wanted to do a Flutter AR app.

##Technologies used
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [ARCore Package](https://github.com/giandifra/arcore_flutter_plugin)

##Learnings
I've learnt that this is not as easy as I thought. The Flutter AR package is still too experimental to do videos and so I did experiments with classic Java code to learn what's under the hood. I found a tutorial but I'm still trying to understand. 

##State of the project
I'm currently stuck in learning the tech. I can display one 3d model, but I actually want to do videos. There's still a lot of work to do. 

##Future
Add a set of matched homework/content to the app itself and then build a platform where teachers can upload the AR content for the app.
